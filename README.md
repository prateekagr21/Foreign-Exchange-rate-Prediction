# Foreign Exchange Rate Prediction

### Deep Learning approach for a Time Series Analysis Problem.
--- 
Here, we are analyzing the exchange rate data of over 11 years of US Dollar in Indian Rupees.

After the Pre-processing of data, \
I predicted the outcome using two Deep Learning algorithms: \
Building the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Model and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, \
and then I compared between these two models that which one outperformed \
by plotting the prediction graphs of the test data.  \
so that the model which performed more efficiently can be chosen for future predictions.
