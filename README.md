# Foreign Exchange Rate Prediction
### Deep Learning approach for a Time Series Analysis Problem.

Here, we are analyzing the exchange rate data of over 11 years of US Dollar in Indian Rupees.

After the Pre-processing of data, 
we predicted the outcome using two Deep Learning algorithms:
Building the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Model and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model,
and then we compared between these two models that which one outperformed
by plotting the prediction graphs of the test data.
